April has arrived once again and I&#39;m delighted to see so many beautiful flowers in bloom on my way to work. It always puts me in a good mood and gives me more energy in the morning. I dream of the day when I can work from home and have a courtyard filled with flowers, grass, and trees. Being surrounded by nature is my ultimate goal as I love everything about it.</p><p>Working in a natural setting would be amazing, as I would get to enjoy the sunshine and fresh air. However, currently, I&#39;m not too fond of my office space. It&#39;s located in a basement storage area, and there are so many cockroaches and dust, making it quite dirty. Despite this, I&#39;ve learned to live with it until I can save enough money to create my dream workspace.</p><p>Well, all of these thoughts are just in my mind, and I must come back to reality and focus on my work. Nonetheless, the sight of the beautiful flowers reminds me of the beauty of nature, and I hope to one day surround myself with it as much as possible.</p><p>üê± Here is my April plan :</p><ol><li>Prepare for the IELTS speaking part 1</li><li>Prepare for the IELTS writing section by writing at least 5 compositions</li><li>Collect interview questions and answers</li><li>Summarize 50 English Pod articles from reputable sources, and create a vocabulary list for each article with example sentences to reinforce your understanding.</li></ol>',6),M=JSON.parse('{"title":"Spring Awakening üå∑","description":"","frontmatter":{},"headers":[],"relativePath":"life/2023/April.md"}'),V={name:"life/2023/April.md"},W=Object.assign(V,{setup(t){return(i,h)=>(r(),s("div",null,[N,P,b(x),T]))}});export{M as __pageData,W as default};
