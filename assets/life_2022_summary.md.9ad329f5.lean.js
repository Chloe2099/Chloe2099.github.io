I have been through a tough time this year and made an important decision that has changed my life. Now, I am living a life I never imagined before. If you are my friend, I think you already know what I am talking about. In the beginning of 2022, I decided to leave my friends and family to move to Beijing. I had never been to the north city in my life, and it was my first time in Beijing. Finally, it took me two weeks to find a new job. Well, it doesn't seem bad. I always think time can prove what is right and what is wrong. No matter what I choose to do, I can bear everything life gives to me.",-1),d=e("p",null,"Although I initially struggled with learning new things, I found that with time and practice, I was able to overcome my fears and become more confident in my abilities. When I begin to do something new, I often imagine it will be difficult and I am afraid of making mistakes. However, I know my weaknesses, so I have to overcome myself. Starting is hard, and the pressure can be difficult to bear. Luckily, I have received a lot of kindness that has made me feel supported. Without that, maybe I wouldn't have been able to stick to it. When I feel unhappy, my friends and family always encourage me and give me favors. The most important thing is that I have met a lot of friends. We can solve tough problems and we love to help each other. I won't forget this period of time.",-1),l=e("p",null,"While there were certainly moments when I felt discouraged or overwhelmed, the kindness and support of my friends and family helped me to stay motivated and focused on my goals. Maybe someone doesn't like their job, and I can say that sometimes I have this feeling too. In a few instances, after I finished work, I would spend an hour on the crowded subway to come back home, feeling really tired and not wanting to do anything. I would just eat dinner and watch videos before going to bed, and when I wake up, I have to go back to work and repeat the cycle. It seems so boring, but that's my life. Also, I don't like it when my boss pushes me to work and expects me to complete everything perfectly in a limited amount of time. Although I do my best, I can't always make everyone satisfied with my work. I have to admit that I used to want recognition from other people, but now I realize that it's not about pleasing everyone else, but about doing my best and finding joy in the simple things in life.",-1),h=e("p",null,"In the end, I learned that it's not always about being perfect or pleasing everyone else, but about doing the best I can and finding joy in the simple things in life.
